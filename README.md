# car-price-prediction
Predicting the price of a used vehicle.

## About Dataset
The dataset contains train and test data. 
The data was generated from a deep learning model fine-tuned on the Used Car Price Prediction Dataset dataset. 

## Approach
1. Importing the necessary Libraries
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#Data Cleaning : handling missing values, outlier detection, univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis 
#Data pre-processing : feature scaling
#Feature engineering : label encoding, one-hot encoding 
3. Model selection and Training: regression models: (linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting)
4. Model evaluation - root mean squared error
5. Model tuning and optimization - fine tune hyper parameters to improve model performance, consider cross validation techniques to validate model robustness
